      "I first saw her in an indie film. Clara Voss. She wasn’t a household name yet, but she would be. I could tell. There was something about her. The way she lit up the screen, the way she made you feel every word she said. She wasn’t like the others. She was real. Raw. Unpolished in the best way. I couldn’t look away.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started innocently enough. I followed her on social media, watched every interview, every short film, every behind-the-scenes clip. She was still an up-and-comer, which made her feel more… accessible. She didn’t have the entourage or the bodyguards yet. She still went to coffee shops alone, still took the subway, still lived in a modest apartment in Brooklyn. She was normal. She was human. And that made her even more perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first it was just admiration. I’d tell myself, \"everyone has a favorite actor.\" But then I noticed things. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she was nervous. The way she laughed too loudly at her own jokes. The way she always wore the same silver bracelet—a gift from her grandmother, she’d mentioned in an interview. These details felt like secrets meant only for me. I began to feel… chosen? Like she was speaking to me through the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t enough. I needed to be closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found her apartment. It wasn’t hard. She’d posted a photo of her street on Instagram, and I recognized the brick facade from one of her interviews. I told myself I just wanted to see where she lived. To feel connected to her. But when I stood outside her building, my heart pounding, I realized I wanted more. I needed to see her. To breathe the same air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time I saw her in person was at a coffee shop near her apartment. She was sitting by the window, typing on her laptop, her hair pulled into a messy bun. She looked… ordinary. Beautiful, but ordinary. I sat at a table across the room, pretending to read a book. I watched her for an hour. The way she sipped her tea. The way she chewed on her pen when she was thinking. The way she smiled at the barista who refilled her cup. I felt alive in a way I never had before.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s when the dreams started. Vivid, surreal dreams where she’d talk to me. Laugh with me. Tell me things she’d never tell anyone else. I’d wake up with my heart racing, the echo of her voice in my ears. It felt real. It WAS real. She was becoming a part of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started leaving her gifts. Nothing intrusive—just small tokens of my admiration. A single daisy on her doorstep. A handwritten note slipped under her door. “You inspire me,” I wrote. “Thank you for existing.” I knew she’d appreciate the sentiment. She had to.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then I saw the headlines. “Clara Voss Speaks Out About Stalker Fears.” My heart sank. She wasn’t grateful. She was scared. Scared of ME. I felt a pang of guilt, but it was quickly overshadowed by confusion. How could she not see how much I cared? How much I UNDERSTOOD her? I wasn’t like the others. I wasn’t dangerous. I jut loved her. Deeply. Passionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I needed to make her understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am almost too ashamed to admit it, but one night I hired an escort. It wasn’t something I’d ever considered before, but the loneliness was becoming unbearable. I spent weeks searching for the right one—someone who looked like her. Not just vaguely similar, but HER. The same shade of brown hair. The same wide, expressive eyes. The same soft smile. When I finally found her, it was like staring into a distorted mirror. She wasn’t Clara, of course, but she was close enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "We met at a hotel. I asked her to wear a specific sweater, one I’d seen Clara in during an Instagram post. She said that roleplaying costs extra. I even brought a book Clara had mentioned loving. She played along. She was kind and accommodating. I made her tell me that she loved me. That she'd never leave me. But it wasn’t enough. She didn’t FEEL like Clara. Her voice was wrong, her mannerisms off. I left feeling emptier than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I saw the photos. Clara and HIM \\*name redacted\\*. Some guy from her new film, all smirks and perfectly tousled hair. They were holding hands and laughing, their faces inches apart. The headlines were relentless. “Clara Voss’s New Romance!” “Hollywood’s Hottest New Couple!” I felt like the world had tilted on its axis. How could she do this? How could she not see that HE was the problem, not me? He didn’t understand her like I did. He didn’t DESERVE her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then it hit me. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. Clara was playing hard to get. She was testing me. She wanted to see how far I’d go, how much I cared. She was pushing me to prove my love. And I would. I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started following him instead. I learned his routines and habits. He was careless, arrogant. He didn’t deserve her. He didn’t deserve to breathe the same air as her. I began to fantasize about what it would feel like to hurt him. Not to kill him. No, that would be too easy. I wanted him to suffer. I wanted him to know what it felt like to be unwanted. Unloved. \n",
      "\n",
      "One night, I broke into his apartment. He wasn’t home, but I left a message. I slashed his favorite leather jacket. The one he always wore in interviews. I wrote on his mirror in red lipstick that probably belonged to her: “Stay away from her.” I knew he’d call the police, but I didn’t care. Let him. Let them all see how far I was willing to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara started posting less online. She canceled public appearances. I knew it was because of me. She was scared, yes. But she was also thinking about me. I could feel it. She was starting to understand. She was starting to SEE. True love really CAN be scary when you experience it for the first time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I broke into her apartment again last night. She wasn’t there, probably staying at a friend’s place. Or a hotel. I didn’t mind. I left another photograph on her nightstand, this one of her and HIM. I’d altered it so that his face was scratched out, replaced with mine. I wrote on the back: “You don’t need him. You have me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, here I am. In his apartment. He’s tied up in the corner, his head lolling to one side. I’ll wake him soon. I need him to understand, just like Clara will. This isn’t about hate. It’s about love. Love that’s pure. Unyielding. Eternal. Clara and I are meant to be. And \\*redacted\\*? He’s just a stepping stone. A lesson. A story to tell our children someday.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been going through his phone. Clara’s coming over tonight. I saw the texts. She’s worried about him. She thinks something’s wrong. Little does she know, everything is about to go so right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight will be our first date. I’ve got everything planned. Candles. Music. A bottle of wine, her favorite: a Pinot Noir she mentioned in an interview once. I even have a ring in my pocket. Just in case things go REALLY well. I know it might seem rushed, but true love waits for no one. And Clara? She’s been waiting for me her whole life, even if she doesn’t know it yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll make her understand. I’ll make them all understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is just the beginning of something beautiful. Clara and I, our story—will be told for generations. Our children, our grandchildren- they’ll want to know how it all began. How love conquered everything. Even fear....\n",

I sighed and picked the banana up, but this time, before eating it and disposing of the peel, I actually paid attention to its outer coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four stickers were affixed to the fruit’s yellow skin—stickers that many bananas wear like badges of honour for their particular brands.

Sometimes they have good reason to, but often, they just don’t see them as a person, at least not the one they once were. Steep bills, hospital visits, and lack of cognitive function can quickly turn a loved one into a liability.

      "“Yes, hi, this is Andrew Reeves, I have a few missed calls from you. What’s going on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause, long enough for my stomach to tie a knot of itself. I knew. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sorry for this, but we’re calling regarding your father. He passed on earlier this morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A hollow, weightless silence. I exhaled slowly, pressing a clammy hand against my forehead. “Um… okay,” I stuttered. I wasn’t sure what else to say. They’d told me he had weeks left.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We know you’re out of town, so we’ve gone ahead and and taken care of everything,” she continued. “Our remote monitors signaled that he passed in his sleep at 11:03 this morning, and the body was picked up at 315 Halloway at 11:42 AM. Given the circumstances, we want to make this process as seamless for you as possible. The remains have already been cremated, per your request. Haven’s Bridge wants to cover the memorial expenses for the trouble”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you that… that means a lot. Wait— he’s already been cremated?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was standard procedure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But—I wasn’t there. I didn’t get to sign off on that yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause. I could hear typing on a keyboard. “You listed ‘disposition at the hospice’s discretion’ on the paperwork,” she said. “You agreed to cremation upon passing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I closed my eyes. Had I? I only vaguely remembered signing forms related to post-mortem conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We wanted to avoid burdening you with the details,” she added. “We understand how difficult this time is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I swallowed. My head felt light, detached from my body. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Right,” I murmured. “Wait, hold on- 315 Halloway? Do you mean 318? That’s where my dad was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A brief silence. Then, a polite, dismissive laugh. “Of course, you’re right. I’m so sorry, it’s been a long morning for all of us here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s… that’s fine.” I brushed it off. “What about.. what about the remains?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you like us to ship them to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I hesitated. “No. I’ll pick them up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course.” A click of a keyboard. “Again, our condolences, Mr. Reeves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We exchanged a few more details, and she hung up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat there for a while, staring at my phone, until eventually it was my turn to stand and collect my carry-on before disembarking the plane. \n",
      "\n",
      "I walked towards baggage claim feeling hollow. I knew it had been coming for a while, but the reality of it was only just setting in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teary-eyed, I pulled his last note to me out of my pocket, and reread as my bags arrived. The crumpled page almost fell apart in my hands, the sweat of my fingers smeared the lettering. I would have taken much better care of it if I’d known it were his last words to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll be here when you get back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the job. I don’t know how I managed to do it, but for the duration of my interview, I must have put myself on autopilot, cruising through handshakes and panel questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived back to my father’s home a few days later, already having made up my mind. I couldn’t live here anymore anyways seeing as I’d start the new job much sooner than I’d anticipated, but now there was nothing tying me here. This would be my last time here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I trudged up the stairs, and began to tear up as I looked down the hall towards my father’s bedroom. Never again would he lay there sick, and never again would we sit next to each other passing notes, joking about sports or the antics of the neighborhood squirrels. I walked up, wanting to go in one more time, but I couldn’t bear to turn the doorknob. He was gone, and it felt like an intrusion to go in without him there. A holdover emotion from when I was a kid. I could worry about his things or selling the house later, for now I just had to worry about moving everything that was mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to pack up what little I needed from my room, and within an hour, my bags were packed and I was ready to leave. There was no way I’d be hauling dad’s furniture to Chicago, so other than my personal effects, it was best to leave the house how it was. Dad had left it to me after all, and with the cushiness of the new job, I could afford my own place and my own stuff in the new city. \n",
      "\n",
      "I could retire here, I thought to myself. But later. When it feels less empty. When I have my own wife and kids to fill its rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was making my last haul to load my belongings into my car when I saw it. A note, folded neatly on the side table in the entryway of the home. Dad must have written it for me after I left, the night before he died. Marla must have left it here for me, bless her. I felt blood rush to my cheeks and for the first time since he passed, I smiled genuinely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked it up and very gently unfolded it, careful not to tear or smudge it. My face dropped, as I opened it and read its short contents. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to leave. Where are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt a hot tear roll down my face. Dad knew I had left for Chicago, at least I had thought so. Did he misunderstand where I was going? Was he so out of it in his last hours that he couldn’t remember where I was?\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I left my father scared and alone when he died?\n",
      "\n",
      "I set the note down where I found it, and quickly got the rest of my stuff. I took one last look inside the house, and left, never wanting to go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d been working the new position for a year when I found the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "After months of settling in, finding a place to stay, and finding my place, I finally worked up the courage to start going through some of Dad’s old things that I’d brought with me. Old journals, a laptop, his baseball card collection. Things I was familiar with but hadn’t had the nerve to unpack since I moved. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was flipping through one of my old yearbooks that he’d kept when a slip of paper poked out from between some of the latter pages. I flipped to where it lay, and was greeted by a photo of me and my first girlfriend preparing for a pep-rally my sophomore year. I smiled, and turned my attention to the note nestled in the crease. My dad’s handwriting was immediately recognizable. Still messier than it used to be, it was distinctly his. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You two were so happy together. She’s still so kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I smiled. Gwen’s braced smile beamed at me through the pages, her freckled face framed with black bangs that she kept even through senior year. Dad was right, we were happy together. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wondered when he’d written the note. Clearly after he got sick based on the handwriting. I wondered how many other notes he’d left for me, hidden like time capsules for me to find while reminiscing. His wording caught me as odd, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wondered why dad would phrase it like that, like he  still knew her, that she was still kind. I puzzled over it for a minute, and realized that he was probably referring to when she showed up to Mom’s funeral after I graduated. We’d been broken up for months at that point, but she was there. I smiled. She had been such a nice girl. \n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "I started finding more of dad’s little “time capsule” notes after that. The second one showed up about two weeks later, tucked between my back seats when I was cleaning out my car.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t forget your oil change”, it mentioned. I chuckled, and made a mental note that funnily enough, I was due for a tune-up sooner rather than later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third and fourth I found within a couple days of each other. One half-buried in the drying dirt of a dying house plant I’d brought from dad’s, reminding me to water it. The other tucked inside a Stephen King book that was one of Dad’s favorites, “You’ll like this next part.” And he was right, the twist got me good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found more and more of my dad, increasingly revealing himself in my life. It felt like a blessing, to find pieces of a loved-one, as alive as he’d ever been, hidden all around me. That’s what I thought at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "I was putting away a few of dad’s things in the closet when I dropped the yearbook, and the note about Gwen fell out again. I picked it up, and noticed something I’d missed before- a phone number, written on the back of it. After 3 years of dialing it by hand on my old flip phone back in school, I recognized it instantly- Gwen’s cell number. Nostalgia shot through me, and I hesitated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Emotion quickly drowned out reason. Surely she’s moved on with her life like I had, but where was the harm in calling her up, as an old friend? Maybe she would even pick up?\n",
      " \n",
      "I dialed the number in, and the phone rang for a few long moments, and just when I was about to hang up, someone answered. A man’s voice, tired and hollow, answered the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello? Who is this? How’d you get this number?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt my heart sink for just a second. It had been 15 years after all, it made sense that the number wouldn’t be hers anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sorry, I figured this wouldn’t work. I was trying to call up an old…. Friend. Gwen Matthews.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man paused for a second, and shocked me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you… you have the right phone number, this is Omar. Gwen’s husband. May I ask who this is?” He seemed tense. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, sorry to bother you, I just.. my name is Andrew Reeves, I was a friend of Gwen’s from high school. I.. I found her number again and just wanted to check in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was silence for a second, but he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah. Well, Andrew, I’m sorry to tell you this, but.. um..”\n",
      "I heard his voice break, “Gwen passed a few years back. She was in an accident. I’d kind of assumed everyone who knew her already heard. Anyways, um, I didn’t even know her phone was still turned on until you called. I’ll be shutting it off tonight. Thanks for calling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A click, and he hung up. I sat there in shock. I hadn’t known what to expect, but… I just couldn’t believe she was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in a haze for the next few days. Why’d dad tell me she was “still kind”? Did he know she was gone? Why didn’t I know that she’d died? I guess that’s what happens when you don’t speak to someone for 15 years. They move on. Sometimes, they pass on. \n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t stay frazzled forever though, I had a shareholder meeting to prepare for. A potential promotion rode on the results, so I’ll admit I splurged and bought a new suit and binder to look extra professional. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of the meeting, I found dad’s next note. I opened my binder to remove some documents and out fell a pristine sheet of paper, one I hadn’t placed there when I meticulously prepared for the meeting the night before. I quickly put it aside to get to my documents, but it immediately caught my eye. I had only bought this binder last week, and I certainly didn’t own this notepad back when I lived with dad. But there it was, unmistakably, in Dad’s handwriting. “Good luck Andrew. I love you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The impossibility of the note perplexed me. Driving home from work that day, I puzzled it over in my head until it made even less sense than before. There was no way that he had put the note in the binder, as I had only bought it a week prior. And there was definitely no way that it had somehow gotten shuffled around when I was unpacking and ended up in there, it was in pristine, unfolded condition. I couldn’t make any sense of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "More notes started appearing in places that, in hindsight, always should have set off alarm bells in my head. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m cold”, I found underneath my fridge when I was sweeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning I booted up dad’s old laptop again, only for a note to slip out of the disc drive. “Im not feeling any better. Can you help me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of his most recent notes that let to where we are now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I returned home from work one day, frazzled that I’d found a letter seemingly from him in my packed lunch. I opened my mailbox and began sorting through my mail, when one letter stuck out like a sore thumb among the rest. A final bill with a familiar logo was nestled between advertisements, a bill from Haven’s Bridge. Written on the back of the envelope, my father’s handwriting scrawled “When are you coming home? I miss you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I lost it. I tore open the envelope, this had to be coming from them somehow. My father had been dead for well over a year at this point. I had attended his funeral, his ashes sat on my fireplace. Someone was writing me notes to mess with me, and it HAD to be them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill was fairly standard, albeit with a hefty late payment fee attached. I scoffed that they’d send me one this long after everything concluded, but almost everything seemed in order. Bills for oxygen tanks depleted, moving time and in-home care, everything seemed exactly as it should. No message, no taunt with my father’s handwriting, no ghostly scrawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t until I was about to throw the note away when I caught it, in the fine line print at the very bottom of the bill. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Services rendered to: Andrew Reeves, 315 Halloway Drive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Those idiots had messed up the address again, no wonder it took so long to forward this bill to my new address. I wondered how many other late payments had been incurred by the clerical error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furious, I called the number for Haven’s Bridge, now saved to my phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone rang twice before someone picked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haven End Hospice, how can we help?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll admit, I was curt, harsh even with my tone. “Listen, I’m calling about a billing issue. My name’s Andrew Reeves. My father, Richard Reeves, was in your care last year. I was finally forwarded his bill, and I want to contest these late fees seeing as it was you guys who got the address wrong, again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause. Then the faint click of a keyboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited, listening to the faint murmur of voices in the background. Then, another pause—longer this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“…I’m sorry, Mr. Reeves. I seem to be having some trouble pulling up your father’s file.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I scoffed. “That can’t be right, I have your bill right here. You guys did hospice care, cremation, funeral arrangements, everything. Your nurse Marla was at his house almost every day for a month.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right, of course, I just—” More typing. “Give me one second. Let me check something else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a shuffle, like she was flipping through papers. I heard a hushed voice—another woman, in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, just clear enough to make out: “Wait, this wasn’t the Halloway mixup was it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cold pit in my stomach opened wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The line clicked. Call ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hard to get time off of work to get back home\n",
      "to Dad’s place, but by the end of the month I convinced my boss to let me have a long weekend to fly back home. \n",
      "\n",
      "I splurged on the in-flight WiFi. I wanted to do as much digging on Haven’s Bridge as I could before I got back to Dad’s. Nothing was adding up. What I found online was scarce- they were a family owned business that had only been in operation for a couple of years by the time I found them. They specialized in elder care and end of life treatment, but their reviews weren’t the best. When I’d booked I’d known all this, but for the price point, they were about all I could afford at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was more worrying was that they had VERY recently been shut down. From the articles I could find, they’d closed just days after my last phone call with them. One forum post from my dad’s city even claimed that they’d mishandled remains, and there was an ongoing lawsuit. None of this was comforting.\n",
      "\n",
      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "The taxi pulled up to my childhood home. I was sad to see that it had fallen into almost a state of disrepair in my year absence. I could have at least called a company to take care of the lawn, but I hadn’t even done that. Tall, dead grass carpeted the lawn, and the windows were caked with what looked like dirt. It wasn’t until I arrived closer to the house and my stomach dropped as I realized the filth was moving- thousands of flies, buzzing and landing inside on the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "I swallowed hard and put my key in the door. I barely turned the handle and cracked it when the smell hit me like a dead fish. My eyes watered, and I pushed my way inside, fighting back the flies that pushed past me to escape into the fresh afternoon air. It was several minutes worth of coughing and opening every window I could find downstairs that I paused to let myself breathe and get my bearings. I wish I hadn’t. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were hundreds, no, thousands, of scrawled letters on the ground. Some were crumpled, some in perfect condition. Most of them rotting and covered in dead insects. \n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up one that seemed relatively fresh and unspoiled, and to my dismay it still held a damp slimy texture. I peeled it open, and it read “Will you be back soon? Please let me out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew what I’d find before I even started walking upstairs. The smell had hung heavy in the ground floor foyer but the stench of rot only grew more sickly sweet with every step I took towards my father’s room. My the time I made it to his door, I had to put my shirt over my nose just to keep myself from vomiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I grabbed the handle and started to twist, only to realize with a gut-wrenching understanding that it had been locked. I pulled out the old house key from my key ring and fidgeted with the lock. As soon as the key clicked, the door flung open.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father’s withered body pushed it out towards me, he’d been leaned up against it. The inside of the door was covered in deep scratches, splintered wood caked in long-dried blood covering the floor. His fingers had been whittled down to bone, his hands mangled and still grasping to claw towards an escape. \n",
      "\n",
      "I turned away from what lay before me, and I vomited. I wiped my mouth clean, and slowly walked past my father into his old room. Every single piece of hospice equipment was inside. The monitors, long knocked over and broken, covered in flies and filth. They’d forgotten him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was reeling, struggling to understand the sight before me. How had they not known? How had they left him here to die? Whose ashes did I have in an urn at home?\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t bear the smell any more, so I cracked open my father’s window, and caught a glimpse of Mr. Prescott’s house across the street, similarly overgrown. No family or friends to take care of it, his house had gone the way of my dad’s. It wasn’t until I looked at his house number, 315 Halloway, that the realization hit me like a brick.\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned away from the window, my head spinning, and I shifted my gaze towards the door. \n",
      " \n",
      "My father’s body was gone, a pool of blood and wood splinters where he had laid was all that remained in his place. My heart sank as a looked at the scratches he’d left on the back of his door. They were bloody and messy, but I could now clearly see that they were words.\n",

      "Shortly after posting, the user added a comment with a link. Clicking it led to a barren webpage with nothing but an input field for an eight-digit code and a white star symbol. No context. No instructions. Even the star was plain—just a black-outlined five-point drawing on a white background.\n",

      "It didn’t take long for users to discover that opening the star image in a text editor revealed a long, confusing string of letters. Another mod, my friend Snooze91, figured out an hour later that decrypting the text led to a URL, which pointed to Google Maps coordinates in Australia. \n",

Snooze and I spent nights in voice chat, blasting progressive metal - he loved Dream Theater - and analyzing the clues. We were sure it would all lead back to a final code for the initial webpage.\n",

      "After hours of trying everything, I had an idea. The long string from the image contained mostly letters, except for a few numbers: 3, 5, and 1. “Maybe it’s a page number,” I thought and messaged Snooze. He had bought the eBook earlier and started reading, hoping to find the answer.\n",
      "\n",

      "The sequence looked unmistakably like a phone number, and the area code even made sense. Snooze and I buzzed with excitement.\n",

      "User-Written Content: Mike and I had been friends since school. We would always go on these adventures as we lived by a huge national forest. We normally stuck to the trails and always kept a compass with us. It was of course easy to get lost in the woods. We had planned to head out early one day and try to go further than we had ventured before. \n",
      "\n",
      "He came to my house just after 6:00am, and I drove us over to a clearing in the forest. We used this as well as others as a start point to the many trails that meandered off into the woods. Most of these we had walked for many years all of them sign posted and color coded. That way you could find your way back. \n",
      "\n",
      "We took the red route, this then merged onto the purple route. We got about 4 hours in to our hike when we came across a half covered sign up ahead. Underneath the sign it looked like an old track ran straight through the forest, of course it looked unused in years but still distinguishable against the surrounding foliage.  “Let’s follow it for a few clicks”, Mike suggested, his eyes gleaming with curiosity, “see if it goes anywhere”. I was hesitant, but the temptation of exploration lured me in, I nodded in agreement. \n",
      "\n",
      "The track had been reclaimed by the forest and was difficult to follow but sure enough through the trees we could see a building up ahead. We must have walked the uneven track about half an hour already, so we could do with a rest. As we neared the building a few hand written signs welcomed us, ‘KEEP OUT’, ‘PRIVATE PROPERTY’, and ‘TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT’. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place was obviously abandoned, the threats hollow. The door was chained shut, rust covering the metal. We found a broken piece of iron fencing and, after a few failed attempts, snapped the brittle lock. The chain fell away with a painful screech, and we pried the door open, releasing a cloud of dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we walked in the floorboards creaked and the rooms echoed. The place looked untouched since the 80’s at least. Streams of light filtered through the boarded up windows exposing boar and stag heads hung around the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "We split up, Mike took the stairs while I explored the kitchen. The house, though heavily decayed, was eerily pristine, as if someone had meticulously preserved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything up there, Mike?” I called out, my voice breaking the uneasy silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nah, man,” he shouted back. “Just dusty as hell!” I nervously laughed and agreed. My humour drained as I noticed faint tapping coming from the door beneath the staircase. I tried to open it but it wouldn’t budge. \n",
      "“Mike, get down here, help me with this door!” I yelled. Together, we both pulled at the doorknob. We heard a small click and as it began to whine open, the hinges screamed at us in protest. \n",
      "\n",
      "We both turned our flashlights to the opening, there was a staircase leading to a basement. The steps were crooked and disjointed we held onto the wooden rail as we descended. There was an old switch that illuminated at the bottom, I tried flicking it. Nothing, as I expected. We flooded the room with our flashlights, there were glass cases lining the wall with a central case in the middle. All of them covered in a thick layer of dust. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Jesus,” Mike whispered, gagging. “It smells like something died in here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a large gulp. “This doesn’t feel right, man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, fuck,” Mike gasped, his voice quivering. “What the hell is that?”\n",
      "\n",
      " I turned my light to him, He’d wiped off the dirt that covered glass case, revealing a waxy figure of a woman, her features grotesquely distorted. I felt a lump at the back of my throat once more, “what the hell is this place man?!” We wiped a few more and again our eyes were met with more creepy looking wax like dolls all clothed in ball gowns, their polished eyes seemed to follow our every move.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is fucked up dude!” I muttered, while trying to keep composed. Mike’s voice broke. “That’s nothing, dude. Look in the middle case.” There hanging was the clothed remains of a person bound together by former muscles. I retracted back nearly dropping my flashlight, “we need to get out of here Mike, this place feels rotten!” I noticed a withered yellow stained envelope on a small wooden table next to the central case. We heard a loud tap on one of the glass cases behind us, we nearly jumped out of our skin. Mike stuttered “Grab it and run! I don’t care what it is, we need to go!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As we began to climb the stairs multiple thuds echoed out behind us, like the cased occupants were trying to get free. As we got to the top, the deafening sound of screams followed. We crashed the door shut and ran out of that place like there was no tomorrow, we were spooked, we felt like we had just crawled out of hell. \n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t stop running until we came to the trail point once again. This trip was over for us, we didn’t want to be in this forest anymore. We got back to my car about 3 hours later. \n",
      "\n",
      "We sat dishevelled in the front seats, I pulled the envelope from my coat pocket and opened it. A hand written note was inside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what the note read: \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, \n",

      "\n",
      "I wasn’t always a collector though, no. I worked for the family business. We were animal technicians, we would prepare deceased pets and hunters trophies as preserved things of beauty. I was good, maybe the best at what I did for 20 years I was a master taxidermist. One day a family came to me with an offer, it was a rare one and one which I hadn’t come across before. They wanted me to work on a deceased relative, it was the family’s and the deceased persons wish, to preserve them forever. At first, I was horrified but they were willing to pay 5 times my yearly salary. \n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke with my two brothers and father, they opposed it profusely. They said it was immoral, forbidden and above all illegal. After this point I left the family business, due to, creative differences. I set up a small business of my own, I was in control. I worked on the family’s relative, a thing of beauty. Capturing someone eternally is something to be admired, no? I didn’t get another offer of this kind but it intrigued my creativity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first of my collection came by chance, I was often lonely and needed some company. I lived out of the way not many people only the odd hiker, I preferred it like that. I picked up a young lady as she was working her usual spot on an evening in a town about 10 miles away. We went back to my place and things got a bit crazy, a mixture of pills and alcohol were the main guests at our party. When I became more aware a few hours later, my company had unfortunately expired. Such a pretty young thing I couldn’t just let her fade away into dust, she needed to be frozen in time. I was the one that could make that happen, an everlasting beauty. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I cleaned her up and worked my magic, she was a natural masterpiece. Once I had finished I dressed her in a stunning yellow dress, she was ready for her podium. I placed young Monique behind a glass case with a small plaque “Monique, the original beauty”. This unbeknown to me would be the first of many, I must admit the many ‘accidents’ may have been slightly forced by me, what can I say I was impatient. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My collection now stands at over 43 individual pieces of elegance. They are all lavishly dressed and cased, stood in an eternal walk way of the exquisite and grace. Many may have other feelings towards what I do, what I collect, but after all I only encapsulate a brief moment of life, and present it eternally.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have nearly completed my collection, after all these years. As I place the last case in the center of my hall of trophies. I fit the rope to the top of my podium. I will not be preserved, I will not be eternal but at least I will be surrounded by pure, beautiful artistry. \n",

      "\n",
      "We both decided to report this to the police with this note as evidence. They searched for miles into the woods, for days, weeks even. they found no buildings, no signs or anything. I think they even started believing that we had made it all up as some sick joke. It just didn’t make sense, it wasn’t hidden at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "We  both didn’t understand, but we  know what we saw out there. The proof was written in the twisted note.\n",

      "I had found the letters while Clara was out of the house running an errand. Immediately I ran to my phone and checked the security footage. Obviously since those letters had come through the mail, there was technically no reason to think someone had come by the house. That didn’t keep me from feeling insanely uneasy, even after the camera turned up no signs of suspicious activity. I scrubbed through all of the saved footage—about two days worth—at least three times before I felt confident that I hadn’t missed anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was checking the footage, I made the mistake of leaving the letters open on the counter. Clara made it home and saw them lying there. When I returned to the kitchen she was sobbing, reading them and covering her mouth in disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is this? Who would say this?” Tears were streaming down her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrapping my arms around her, I said, “I don’t know. But they’re just letters. I won’t let anything happen to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I’d been telling the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, as we were getting ready for bed, I realized I had forgotten to take the trash can out to the street. Clara didn’t want me going outside now that it was dark, but I told her I’d only be out there for like fifteen seconds. She relented, but set up a chair by our window to watch me. I thought it was overkill, but she was understandably paranoid. And I was grateful to know that she cared enough about me to be worried for my safety. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was cold, so I was dragging the garbage can out as fast as I could, and I wasn’t paying much attention to my surroundings. When I reached the street, though, I happened to look up. Down the street a little ways, and on the other side, was the silhouette of a person. They were standing in a neighbor’s yard staring at me. The person looked to be wearing a hood, but that was all I could tell. They didn’t move even as I stared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The person didn’t move. Feeling very unsettled, I headed back into my house, checking constantly over my shoulder. I half expected the person to start charging toward me with a knife or an axe, but that didn’t happen. Once inside, I dead bolted the front door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who were you talking to?” Clara asked as soon as I made it into our bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "I peeked through the blinds to look for the guy, and realized from this angle there was no way to see the front yard where he had been standing. Our bedroom is right next to the front door with the camera as well, so most likely the hooded figure wouldn’t be on camera either.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” I said. “I’m just being paranoid, I guess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara looked unhappy with that answer. We went to bed shortly thereafter, but I couldn’t sleep. I laid there trying for about an hour, but I couldn’t get my mind off everything that had been happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "*Tap. Tap. Tap.* Someone knocking on the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard a male voice whisper: “Clara!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara gasped. I sat up bolt upright in bed and she screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you hear that?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I ran to the window and looked out. Nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wondered about going outside and looking around, but was too freaked out to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s not the first time that’s happened,” Clara whispered, voice shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The knocking. I’ve heard it before. I’ve never heard him say anything before just now, but I’ve heard him knocking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the bed. “There was someone knocking on the window and you didn’t say anything?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know for sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you were hiding this from me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t want to stress you out or make you mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think I would get mad at you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara started to cry. “I didn’t know! I was scared!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All I’ve tried to do so far is help you. I’ve never been closed off or anything, at all. I even bought that doorbell camera—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a fucking *doorbell* camera. It doesn’t cover the whole house, you idiot!” Clara started sobbing with full force. Why was she acting like this? Of course it was a serious situation, but why didn’t she want to trust me?  Sighing heavily, I stepped out of the room because I had no idea how to comfort her. After drinking some water, I reentered our bedroom and found my wife lying silently in bed. I lay down next to her and mumbled, “I’m sorry.” I tried to fall asleep after that, but it was impossible. \n",
      "\n",
      "Judging by her breathing patterns, Clara couldn’t sleep either. I thought about saying something else, talking to her since we were both awake, but I didn’t. I just couldn’t think of the right words. It occurred to me then that she had to be terrified—some psycho was sending her flowers and perverted love letters and walking around our house, and she had no clue who it was. However scared I was probably didn’t even compare to the fear she had to be feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I felt really guilty for suspecting her of cheating. How could I have been so stupid?\n",
      "\n",
      "When I awoke the next day, Clara had already left for work. Immediately I grabbed my phone off the nightstand and called the police, telling them everything that had happened. It seemed like the best move. \n",
      "\n",
      "The lady on the other end agreed to file a report. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all you can do? This person was on our property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without evidence of a crime being committed, we can’t do a whole lot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just don’t want things to get any worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we can send an officer over in the next few days to check things out. He can see what the situation is and probably scare the guy off if he happens to be in the area.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Okay, thank you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it was better than nothing. I’d have liked more in the way of protection, but a police officer coming over was a good sign. Maybe the lady was right and that would scare this creep away for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days came and went. The police officer did not show up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stalker was also silent. For those few days, there were no presents or visits from the person. Maybe this thing had worked itself out, I thought. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the cake arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara and I had gone on a walk. I know I locked the door because I distinctly remember fumbling with the key to unlock it again. When we pushed open the door, my wife gasped. I followed her gaze to a chocolate cake that was sitting on the kitchen counter. It had been set on one of our own plates. \n",
      "\n",
      "That had not been there when we left. It would have been impossible for one of us to have placed it there. Someone must have been in our house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately I searched the area. The house was clear though, as was our yard and the neighbors’ property. Whoever had left the cake was gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clara was crying when I returned, and she taken up a defensive position, arming herself with one of the kitchen knives. Her back was to the wall. I inspected the cake itself. It was covered in chocolate frosting and chocolate covered strawberries, with a plastic heart poking out of the center. \n",
      "\n",
      "Who would do this? And why did I feel so helpless about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought for sure calling the police would work this time. But as luck would have it, I didn’t need to. Out the corner of my eye, I saw a police cruiser pulling up to the curb and parking. We both ran out to meet it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A older police officer stepped out of it. His face was weathered and sealed off, like he’d seen some shit in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You reported a stalking incident?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara glanced at me, as if to say *Well, that was fast.*\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yeah, I did,” I answered. “Come inside. He just struck again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I led the man into our home and shut the door. I motioned for Clara to grab the last batch of letters from our bedroom closet. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me what all’s been going on here,” the officer breathed. I explained the events of the last month or so, to which he seemed relatively uninterested. Maybe he doesn’t show his thoughts like that on the outside, I thought. Or he really just doesn’t care. Either way, I finished telling him the story, and Clara handed him the love letters she’d received. He skimmed them, then glanced at the cake on the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far he’s sent you letters and a cake, and stood across the street.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He didn’t send us the cake. When we got home it was sitting on the counter. He’s been *in the house.”*\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are there any signs of a break-in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uh…you can look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Reluctantly the man stepped outside and walked the perimeter of our house, checking the doors and windows for evidence of forced entry. A few minutes later he was standing in our doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No scratches or stray paper clips?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None that I can see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there anything you can do?” Clara chimed in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can file a report. That’s it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it?” I said. “Can’t you do an investigation? Or could you send a guy out here to watch the house for a night or something?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer stepped back onto the porch. “Since there’s no evidence of illegal activity, we can’t launch an investigation. All I can do is file a report.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fucking cake isn’t evidence?”\t“I’m afraid it’s not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bullshit,” Clara mumbled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If anything else happens, call us.” He turned, walked back to his car, and drove off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara watched the cruiser with seething anger in her eyes. I sighed and dropped onto the couch. \n",
      "\n",
      "“We might as well eat the cake now,” I groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! What if it’s poisoned or drugged?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fair enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That night we went out for dinner. I triple checked all the locks before we left. Still felt like I was leaving the house wide open, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hard to focus on the burger and fries in front of me when all I could think about was how infuriating the conversation with the police officer had been. Clara felt the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do we do now?” She asked, taking a half-hearted bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait till there’s evidence, I guess,” I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s so stupid. There is 100% some kind of evidence that he could investigate. It’s just so…”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know.”\tWe ate in silence for a minute. Then she broke the silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think someone’s been following me home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” I leaned forward instinctively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait, wait,” she sighed. “I don’t want to you to get all—like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like this? Like what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know for sure. I just feel like I’ve noticed a car tailing me the last few days. Maybe I’m crazy. I probably shouldn’t have mentioned it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crazy? You know some guy is creeping around the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re right. I just didn’t want to worry you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why are you so…scared of me? I don’t get it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not scared of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You keep hiding these things from me that are really worrying you. That’s not healthy, right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You never really ask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never ask? Can’t you just tell me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should be able to tell on your own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re saying I should just know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You never notice the details and it really pisses me off sometimes,” she said, raising her voice slightly. Then she shook her head and lowered her volume again. “Actually, just…forget I said anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a serious situation, Clara. You’re being stalked! Can’t we talk about this like adults?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you saying I’m a child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’m not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s what that sounds like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just forget it.” I wanted to crush my styrofoam cup in my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We drove home in silence. Clara mumbled that we should go to a hotel instead, but by that time it was late and there were no hotels nearby where we could get a room. Besides, we probably couldn’t afford it. I said I’d keep awake for her, but that wasn’t much of a comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything looked normal at the house, at least. Besides the cake that was still on the counter, nothing was out of place. We settled into bed, and I prepared to keep myself awake for the night. I figured it would make work the next day a challenge, but it was worth it just in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember playing Solitaire on my phone. Then the smoke detector went off. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clara jolted awake and screamed. I shook my head back and forth and tried to grab my phone, which was buried somewhere in the sheets. I realized I’d fallen asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shrill beeping sound hurt my ears. My heart was pounding like a kettle drum. Clara turned on the light in the room, and I decided to give up on finding my phone. Standing up, I charged into the house, ready for anything. Had someone set our house on fire? At this point, anything was on the table, I thought—but when I made it into the kitchen and flicked the light switch, I stopped cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were hundreds of sheets of pink paper taped all around the kitchen. The walls, the counter, the door frame, the ceiling, even—every inch of it was covered in pink paper. Looking closer, I realized each of them were cut into the same shape. A heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much time and effort had to go into this. And for what?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara came up behind me, shouting something over the still beeping smoke detector, but she stopped her sentence halfway through when she saw the state of the kitchen. I grabbed her, worried she was about to faint.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t say anything for a while, just listened to the constant beep coming from the ceiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I said, “Should we call the police again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just turn off that fucking beep sound!” She screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrenched away from me and ran to the couch, where she promptly curled up and started crying. For a second I just stood there, torn between stopping the alarm and comforting her.  Finally I slid a chair up to the wall and climbed up to the smoke detector.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little switch on it, with three options: off, auto, and test. It was on the test setting, and when I switched it to auto, the sound ceased. Whoever covered our kitchen in paper hearts had set off the smoke detector as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the sound off and the house in total silence, I could finally breathe normally again. Sitting down on the chair, I tried to think of what to do next. The police weren’t much help earlier, but this was way more noticeable. Surely this would warrant some kind of investigation, right? Or should I just stay up and see if the stalker tries to come by again? I could take him out myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think he’s still here?” Clara whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hadn’t thought about that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately I searched the house, but couldn’t find anyone. I checked under the bed and in the cabinets too, just in case, but no one was there. The intruder had disappeared into the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I found Clara again she was sitting upright, texting on her phone. She looked up at me, eyes bloodshot and tears running down her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going to Sarah’s house,” she sniffled. Sarah is her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t say anything, but followed silently as Clara stood and made her way to her car. She was making the right decision. She was clearly not happy with me, and as long as she was safe I figured a little space would help us a lot. Now we could both think about our next move without arguing with each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before she drove off, Clara made sure to search every inch of the car, just in case someone was hiding in there. Smart.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, she drove away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After watching her leave, I was scared to go back inside. For a while, I just stood leaning against the door, trying to think of a solution to the problem. It was so cold that I could see my breath, but that didn’t matter to me. I just didn’t want to confront those sheets of pink paper. \n",
      "\n",
      "We couldn’t afford to just move away. We could stay with family members for little while like Clara was doing, but not for long since none of our relatives live near the places where we work. Options were limited since the police weren’t helping much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to stop this for good. I wanted our lives to get back to normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breathing in sharply, I pushed open the door and went inside. It was eerie, all alone in the dark, stepping over dozens of heart shaped papers. I expected someone to jump out of the shadows and attack me, but no one did.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our bedroom, I found my phone lying on the floor. I checked the doorbell camera app, but there was no motion detected at any point. I scrubbed the footage, but found nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 2 AM, and I had work on the morning. After what had just happened, I didn’t feel comfortable sleeping in my bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exhausted and not willing to drive anywhere, I just crawled into our closet and shut the door. The floor wasn’t comfortable at all but I was so tired that I just fell asleep immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I woke up it was still dark outside. I spat out the fuzz from the carpet and tried to sit up. My back was insanely sore from the position I’d been curled up in. I fumbled around the closet, trying to find my phone. I found it and checked the time. The light was blinding, but I was able to read 5:30 AM. It felt like I hadn’t slept at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light from the phone lit up the wall of the closet. Even though my eyes were still adjusting, I thought I noticed something weird on the wall. It was dark, and about the size of a credit card. I touched it and found empty space. It was a hole that I’d never noticed before.\n",
      "\n",
      "For whatever reason I reached further in and started fumbling around in the gap. In a couple seconds there was a loud cracking sound and a huge piece of the wall fell inward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stood up so fast I slammed my head into the bar we hang clothes on. Once I’d turned on the light I shoved the clothes out of the way and crouched down to investigate further.\n",
      "\n",
      "The part of the wall I pushed in looked like some kind of panel that was made of a slightly different material. We’d never noticed it before, probably because it was hidden behind our clothes. I poked my head inside and found a decent sized space on the other side of the wall. It wasn’t huge but it could easily fit a person standing up. Using my phone flashlight I got to my feet inside of the space.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I noticed were the pieces of paper taped to the walls. At least a dozen of them, scattered around in a type of collage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I plucked off one of the sheets of paper to look at it, and my heart dropped. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a photo of Clara. Taken from outside our house, looking in through an open window.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were more pictures, each of them more terrifying than the last as they grew closer and closer to her. Some showed her in her car, on the way to work. One of them was taken behind the bushes next to the front door of her office building, showing her unlocking the door. Another showed her on a walk by herself—this one was taken from inside a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they got worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a photo of our bed, while we were both asleep. And another of Clara doing laundry. And another of Clara and me making out on the couch.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of those were taken from inside the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "*How did I never notice?*\n",
      "\n",
      "I crouched back down again and stared through the open space in the closet wall. It offered a perfect view of our bed. I felt something on the floor and held it up to the light. It was a pair of my wife’s panties. I dropped it, my stomach churning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I climbed back out and put the loose panel back where it was. Now the tiny gap in the wall I’d used to find the panel seemed so obviously out of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without waiting a second I called the police. They promised to send an officer over immediately. I thanked the operator, then called Clara. She didn’t pick up, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried again a few times, but Clara still wouldn’t pick up. Was she still upset with me? Or was something else going on?\n",
      "\n",

      "User-Written Content: It had been weeks of strange occurrences, tiny whispers in the dark, objects shifting around the house, and a nagging feeling that I couldn’t shake. My daughter, Lily, had been talking about her “friend” again. She was only six, so I didn’t think much of it at first. Most kids have imaginary friends, right? But this one was different. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily had been spending more and more time with her friend, often speaking in hushed tones, laughing to herself, and sometimes even seeming... frightened. It made me uneasy, but I told myself I was overthinking it. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re just tired,” I’d tell myself. But that night, when Lily came to me, her face pale and drawn, something in my gut told me this was different.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mommy,” she whispered, “please don’t let him hurt me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt a cold chill run down my spine, my heart skipping a beat. \"Who, sweetie? Who’s going to hurt you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man in the corner,” she said, pointing to the dark corner of her room, where the shadows seemed to press in tighter than usual. “He says he’s my friend, but I don’t want to play with him anymore. He’s mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked over to the corner, trying to mask the fear rising in my throat. There was nothing. Just shadows. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Honey, there’s no one there. It’s just your imagination. You’re safe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the look on her face told me she wasn’t convinced.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He wants to come out, Mommy. He says you’ll be sorry if you don’t let him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I smiled weakly, brushing her hair from her forehead. “He’s not real. We’ll talk about it in the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, I lay awake in bed, my mind swirling with a hundred thoughts. Was it just a phase? Was I overreacting? The whole thing felt wrong, though. Like something wasn’t quite right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next few days were worse. Lily refused to go near that corner. She began having nightmares—waking up in tears, crying about the man in the corner who wanted her to play, who told her things. Dark things. Things I didn’t want to hear. \n",
      "\n",
      "One night, I went into her room to find her curled up in a ball, her eyes wide with fear. I sat down next to her, smoothing her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What happened, Lily?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw him again,” she whispered, trembling. “He’s standing there... in the corner. And he says... he says he likes to play with people, Mommy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I glanced toward the corner, but there was nothing there. Only the dark. The shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m right here,” I said, pulling her close, “and I won’t let anyone hurt you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily didn’t respond, her eyes locked onto the corner. I followed her gaze, my heart pounding. For a split second, I thought I saw something—just a flicker, a shadow that seemed to move. My blood ran cold. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, when I picked her up from school, Lily wasn’t waiting at the gate like usual. Instead, a teacher came up to me, her face ashen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Peterson, you need to come with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart sank. I followed her into the teacher’s lounge, where another staff member was sitting with Lily. Her face was pale, and her eyes were wide with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lily? What happened?” I asked, kneeling in front of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She trembled. “He came to school. He told me to come with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My stomach twisted into knots. “Who, honey? Who came to school?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “The man with the hat. He says he’s my friend, but he’s not. He’s not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I stared at her, unable to process the words. “Sweetheart, there’s no man. It’s all in your imagination. We’ve talked about this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The teacher spoke up. “Mrs. Peterson, we found something strange. Lily had written something on the back of her worksheet.” She handed me the paper. \n",
      "\n",
      "On it was a simple drawing—a tall man in a hat, with a dark, twisted smile. Beneath the drawing, in Lily’s shaky handwriting, it said:\n",
      "\n",
      "*He will be here soon.*\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt the blood drain from my face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following days were a blur of confusion and fear. I kept Lily home from school, hoping it was just a phase, hoping my daughter wasn’t losing her mind. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. That *he* was real. \n",
      "\n",
      "That night, I decided to confront whatever was haunting my child. I couldn’t keep running from this. I had to face it head-on. I stood at the door of her room, feeling the cold air pressing against my skin, the weight of the dark corner pressing on me. I didn’t know what I was expecting to see, but I had to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a deep breath and walked into the room, flipping on the light. The shadows shifted but nothing moved. Lily sat on her bed, staring at the corner, her face pale, eyes wide with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lily,” I whispered, my voice trembling. “Where is he? Where is your friend?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn’t answer. She just pointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s when I saw it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but as I looked harder, the shape in the corner became clearer. A figure. A man. Tall, thin, dressed in old, tattered clothes. A dirty fedora perched atop his head, casting a shadow over his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked at me, and my breath caught in my throat. He smiled, wide and sickly, revealing teeth that were too sharp, too jagged.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you for finally noticing, Mrs. Peterson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I stepped back, my heart hammering in my chest. My mouth went dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What… what do you want?” I managed to croak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man’s smile twisted even further. “I want what I’ve always wanted. To play.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, before I could scream, something shifted. His face... it wasn’t the man’s face anymore. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was *mine*. \n",
      "\n",
      "My face. My smile. My eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I staggered backward, my knees giving out beneath me. The man—no, the thing—stepped forward, and I recognized the twisted smile from every nightmare I’d ever had. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then it whispered, “I’ve always been here, inside of you, hiding... waiting. You just had to let me out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My own voice, twisted and wrong, echoed back to me. “You... you killed them. All of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The walls seemed to close in, and the truth crashed down on me like a tidal wave. The people who had gone missing in our town. The children who vanished. All the signs, the clues, the police reports, the whispers... it had all been there. It was me. I was the one who had been hiding the darkness inside me, buried deep down. \n",
      "\n",
      "The man wasn’t my daughter’s imaginary friend. *He was me.*\n",
      "\n",
      "And the worst part? \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily wasn’t afraid. She was smiling, her little face glowing with something sinister, something that wasn’t childlike at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "“My real friend’s finally here, Mommy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized, too late, that I hadn’t been protecting my daughter from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been protecting me from *myself*....\n",

And if I could go back in time, I wish I would’ve just let Holland’s bullying dissuade me from by Chalobsession.\n",

      "Christmas Day, 2025.  I had insane FOMO because my parents went to go see the new Bob Dylan bio-pic without me.  I didn’t really give much of a fuck about Bob Dylan, but as it has been established, I absolutely stan Timothy Chalamet.  Honestly, it hurt my feelings a little bit that they didn’t invite me to go see it.  But I also knew what it was like to accompany them on ‘date night’, and honestly I wasn’t really in the mood to see my dad take one to many pulls off his flask and try to make out with my mom to “Queen Jane Approximately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike my parents, however, I knew a way to scratch my Chalamitch without spending a dime.  It was called “putting on the eyepatch.”  So I started surfing around Pirate Bay looking for cam rip of “A Complete Unknown.”  I knew it would be a long shot, given that it was literally opening day, but Chalabeggars can’t be Chaloosers.  Ugh.  Chalooser is another thing Holland called me once while he beat the ever-living fuck out of me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I thought I had struck it gold after an hour of fruitless searching, when I finally found a torrent that seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.  An Incomplete Known.mp4.  I knew that pirates had a tendency to get cheeky with file names, so I figured that’s what was going on.  Some people may have thought it was a red flag that this file had exactly 0 leechers and 1 seeder, but, again, it was a brand new movie and it was Christmas…I figured most people were probably spending time with their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the file was 3.2 GB it downloaded fast…like weirdly fast.  My dad was kind of a dick and sprung for the cheapest cable internet possible, so I was used to it at least taking an hour or so to download a movie…and especially one with just a single seeder?  But hey, I was bored out of my Chalamind so I didn’t question it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Once the MP4 downloaded, I loaded it up into VLC and that’s when things started to get a little Chaluncanny.  First, the cam rip started way earlier than I would have expected.  As in, the person filming started filming before they’d even left their apartment.  And the apartment was absolutely disgusting.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an absolute hovel, with just rotten garbage and shit and pizza boxes everywhere.  It was a single room studio type apartment, looked to be about 300 square feet or so, and just looked absolutely disgusting.  You never were able to see what the person filming looked like (like in the face), but could hear their heavy, labored breathing throughout the entire first segment.  At one point, they brought the camera into the bathroom, set it on the sink, and it sounded like they started taking just the nastiest shit I’ve ever heard.  And they were coughing up a lung and gagging the entire time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the weirdest part of this scene was the bath tub.  It was covered in red stains all around the drain, tub and back wall.  Was it rust?  I really fucking chalahoped so.  I don’t think I could reckon with the alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the camera man leaves his disgusting flat.  On his way out, you can hear a high pitched whining as he passes by the coat closet by the door.  It almost sounded like a person…crying or moaning or something?  At this point, he just stops and films the closet door.  The only audio that can be heard is the high whine and the labored breathing.  It gave me the fucking chalawillies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a couple minutes of that disturbing shit, he heads out the door.  It’s early afternoon when he leaves, and the film cuts.  When it comes back, the camera man is at the movie theater.   But not just any movie theater.  I could recognize from the outside that this guy was at the movie theater that we always attend.  The very same movie theater my parents were at this evening.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I started to Chalapanic a little bit, but was quickly able to talk myself down.  “Lots of theaters look the same” I whispered to myself.  But my relief was short lived once I heard this hulking creep make his way to his seat, and noticed a very familiar silhouette of the couple seated in front of him.  It was my parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of my parents have a very distinctive hair style.  My mom wears her hair long…like weirdly long.  It’s a little bit hippie, but I reckon her hair is about 4 feet long.  She’s About 5’9’’ and her hair goes all the way to her ass.  My dad is horse-shoe bald but has the most insane curly hair I’ve ever seen.  I’d recognize the backs of both of their heads anywhere.  This was getting a little Chalafucked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part about all of this was that the camera man wasn’t even focused on the movie.  I swear to god, the camera was just weirdly focused on the backs of my parents heads.  But what was really fucking weird was the timing of all of this made no sense.  Where the movie should have been in real-time was syncing up perfectly to the time I was watching the video.  In other words, this shot lined up with the actual film as if I were watching some kind of live feed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was an mp4.  How the Chalafuck could that be?  I started to get stressed out and worried, so I called my dad.  Immediately went straight to voicemail.  Of course, he would be the dick who actually turns his phone off when Nicole Kidman told him to in that stupid pre-movie bullshit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So I tried mom next.  I heard a ring…ok…that’s a good start.  And I could actually hear her phone vibrating on the MP4 as well…What the Chalashit???  On screen, I saw her jump, and put her phone on silent and put it back in her purse.  UGH!  Her phone continued to ring and went to voicemail.  I left her a panicked message warning her about the man behind her, but clearly they weren’t going to hear this until after the movie.  I just hope that wasn’t going to be too Chalalate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if I should be relieved or not, but our fucked up videographer decided to leave the movie early and apparently leave my parents alone.  But I don’t know how much better I should feel about that.  The streets he started walking looked oddly familiar to me, and I finally pieced together where he was going to.  It was my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m writing this hiding in the closet now.  I don’t know what the next move is.  All I know is that I’m at the point in the mp4 where he’s filming my front door.  He hasn’t tried to open it yet.  I just see a standard shot of the front door and that breathing.  That insane, hideous, labored breathing.  I fear that I am completely Chalafucked.  ...\n",
